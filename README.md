# Epigenomic-and-transcriptomic-single-cell-analysis-reveals-glial-heterogeneity-in-AD

The gene regulatory landscape of the brain is highly dynamic in health and disease, coordinating a menagerie of biological processes across distinct cell types and cell states. Fully contextualizing abnormal molecular signatures in disease with respect to specific cell types requires a holistic multi-layered experimental and analytical approach. Revolutionary single-cell sequencing techniques have allowed for high-resolution profiling of genomic features in complex tissues composed of heterogeneous cell types, providing a robust platform for dissecting molecular mechanisms of disease. Single-cell transcriptomics has been used extensively in human disease systems, however very few single-cell epigenomic studies have been carried out in primary disease samples. Here, we present a multi-omic single-cell study of 186,167 nuclei in late-stage Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD), in which we profiled chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological samples. We describe cis-regulatory relationships in specific cell types at AD risk loci defined by genome wide association studies (GWAS), demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic single-cell framework for uncovering disease and cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Finally, this work is highly accessible through our intuitive web-portal, allowing for straightforward interrogation of this multi-omic dataset.
